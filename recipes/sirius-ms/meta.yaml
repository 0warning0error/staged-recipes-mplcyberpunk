  summary: "SIRIUS (CLI + GUI) LC-MS/MS data analyses framework. Includes: SIRIUS, ZODIAC, CSI:FingerID (with COSMIC) and CANOPUS"
  description: SIRIUS is a java-based software framework for the analysis of LC-MS/MS data of metabolites and other
    small molecules of biological interest. SIRIUS integrates a collection of our tools, including CSI:FingerID
    (with COSMIC), ZODIAC and CANOPUS.  In particular, both the graphical user interface and the command line version
    of SIRIUS seamlessly integrate the CSI:FingerID and CANOPUS web services.
